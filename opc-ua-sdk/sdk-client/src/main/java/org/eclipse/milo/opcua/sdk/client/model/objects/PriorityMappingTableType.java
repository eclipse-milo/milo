   * <p>Invokes <code>DeletePriorityMappingEntry</code> on this node's ObjectId using the effective
   * Method contract.
   *
   * <p>The Method node is required. Confirmed absence fails with Bad_NotFound; lookup and service
   * failures are preserved. The call does not create a node or retry an invocation.
   *
   * <p>Retains operation status, request and response diagnostics, StringTable and raw outputs.
   * Good and Uncertain outputs are decoded; output metadata and conversion failures remain
   * available separately. Bad results preserve received wire outputs.
   *
   * <p>Returns a non-null future. Lookup, input metadata, transport and response envelope failures
   * complete it exceptionally. Cancellation stops observation and dependent work that has not
   * started; it does not cancel server execution.
   *
   * @param options request-wide diagnostics options for this Call only.
   * @param mappingUri ; the supplied payload may be null.
   * @param priorityLabel ; the supplied payload may be null.
   * @return the detailed outcome, or its future.
   * @throws NullPointerException if a required options or presence object is null (exceptional
   *     completion).
